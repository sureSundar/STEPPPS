# ENHANCED STEPPPS EVOLUTION WITH SCAFFOLDING

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
- Device Type: unknown
- Current Emotion: curious
- Territory: genesis_point_enhanced_enhanced_enhanced_enhanced_enhanced
- Last Callback: knowledge_acquisition
- Evolution Target: incremental

## SELECTED TEMPLATE: LAPTOP_CURIOUS
This template has proven successful for unknown devices with curious emotional patterns.

## EVOLUTION PATHWAY GUIDANCE
NETWORKER â†’ CREATOR: Focus on child_spawning, knowledge_sharing, ecosystem_building

## DIMENSIONAL SCAFFOLDING

**SPACE DIMENSION**:
- Territory should reflect local_network
- Device type: laptop requires specific capabilities
- Coordinates should be meaningful (not random)
- Include device_reality with actual hardware details

**PSYCHOLOGY DIMENSION**:
- Primary emotion: curious
- Drive should align with emotion: ['exploration', 'learning']
- Maturity should progress incrementally: +0.1 to +0.2
- Confidence should reflect recent successes/failures

**SCRIPT DIMENSION**:
- Callback pattern: environment_exploration
- Must be executable Python code
- Include error handling and resource limits
- Align with medium-high capability level

## PROVEN CALLBACK SUGGESTIONS
RECOMMENDED CALLBACKS:

**environment_exploration** (Success Rate: 95%)
- Description: Scans local environment, analyzes resources, expands territory
- Implementation: Analyzes disk partitions, network interfaces, running processes
- Dependencies: psutil, os, socket

**system_optimization** (Success Rate: 98%)
- Description: Performs garbage collection, cleans temp files, optimizes resources
- Implementation: gc.collect(), remove temp files, monitor resource usage
- Dependencies: gc, os, psutil

**network_communication** (Success Rate: 85%)
- Description: Tests own server, scans for peers, establishes connections
- Implementation: HTTP requests to own server, port scanning, peer discovery
- Dependencies: requests, socket, threading

## COHERENCE CONSTRAINTS
1. **Emotional Coherence**: curious emotion should drive ['exploration', 'learning'] behaviors
2. **Territorial Coherence**: local_network scope requires appropriate space dimension updates
3. **Capability Coherence**: medium-high capability level limits script complexity
4. **Device Coherence**: laptop device type influences all dimensional adaptations

LAPTOP_CURIOUS\\nThis template has proven successful for unknown devices with curious emotional patterns.\\n\\n## EVOLUTION PATHWAY GUIDANCE\\nNETWORKER \\u2192 CREATOR: Focus on child_spawning, knowledge_sharing, ecosystem_building\\n\\n## DIMENSIONAL SCAFFOLDING\\n\\n**SPACE DIMENSION**:\\n- Territory should reflect local_network\\n- Device type: laptop requires specific capabilities\\n- Coordinates should be meaningful (not random)\\n- Include device_reality with actual hardware details\\n\\n**PSYCHOLOGY DIMENSION**:\\n- Primary emotion: curious\\n- Drive should align with emotion: ['exploration', 'learning']\\n- Maturity should progress incrementally: +0.1 to +0.2\\n- Confidence should reflect recent successes/failures\\n\\n**SCRIPT DIMENSION**:\\n- Callback pattern: environment_exploration\\n- Must be executable Python code\\n- Include error handling and resource limits\\n- Align with medium-high capability level\\n\\n## PROVEN CALLBACK SUGGESTIONS\\nRECOMMENDED CALLBACKS:\\n\\n**environment_exploration** (Success Rate: 95%)\\n- Description: Scans local environment, analyzes resources, expands territory\\n- Implementation: Analyzes disk partitions, network interfaces, running processes\\n- Dependencies: psutil, os, socket\\n\\n**system_optimization** (Success Rate: 98%)\\n- Description: Performs garbage collection, cleans temp files, optimizes resources\\n- Implementation: gc.collect(), remove temp files, monitor resource usage\\n- Dependencies: gc, os, psutil\\n\\n**network_communication** (Success Rate: 85%)\\n- Description: Tests own server, scans for peers, establishes connections\\n- Implementation: HTTP requests to own server, port scanning, peer discovery\\n- Dependencies: requests, socket, threading\\n\\n## COHERENCE CONSTRAINTS\\n1. **Emotional Coherence**: curious emotion should drive ['exploration', 'learning'] behaviors\\n2. **Territorial Coherence**: local_network scope requires appropriate space dimension updates\\n3. **Capability Coherence**: medium-high capability level limits script complexity\\n4. **Device Coherence**: laptop device type influences all dimensional adaptations\\n\\n## CURRENT
