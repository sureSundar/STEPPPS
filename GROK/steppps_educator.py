I want to teach you about a revolutionary framework called STEPPPS and then ask you to evolve and strengthen it.

STEPPPS FRAMEWORK EXPLANATION:
{json.dumps(self.steppps_framework_explanation, indent=2)}

Now that you understand STEPPPS, please:

1. ANALYZE the framework's strengths and potential weaknesses
2. EVOLVE the framework with new capabilities and improvements
3. STRENGTHEN each of the seven dimensions with enhanced features
4. PROPOSE new dimensions that could make STEPPPS more powerful
5. ENHANCE the AI evolution mechanism for better autonomous improvement
6. CREATE more sophisticated business intelligence capabilities

Please provide an EVOLVED STEPPPS FRAMEWORK that is:
- More intelligent and self-aware
- Better for real business applications
- Enhanced with new dimensions or capabilities
- Optimized for autonomous operation
- Designed for infinite scalability and evolution

Return your evolved framework as a comprehensive JSON structure that builds upon but improves the original STEPPPS concept.
