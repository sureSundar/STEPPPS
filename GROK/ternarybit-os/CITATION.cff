abstract: |
  TBOS operationalizes the STEPPPS seven-dimensional model—Space, Time, Event,
  Psychology, Pixel, Prompt, Script—into a reliable, inspectable substrate for
  autonomous devices. With grammar-constrained LLM outputs, content-addressed
  compute on PXFS, and RF/optical file systems (RF2S/PF2S), TBOS enables
  predictable autonomy across device classes.
