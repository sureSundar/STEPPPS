## QUICK REFERENCE: KEY NUMBERS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Source Files** | 213 |
| **Lines of Code (src/)** | 18,134 |
| **Lines of Code (kernel/)** | 9,329 |
| **Stub/Non-Functional Code** | ~40% |
| **Documentation Files** | 90 |
| **TODO/FIXME Comments** | 28+ |
| **Components Fully Missing** | 4-5 |
| **Network Stack Size** | 24 total lines! |
| **Shell Implementation** | 16 lines (stub!) |
| **Boot Configs** | 40+ variations |
| **Implementation Completeness** | ~30% |

---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY

### The Problem
- **Gap**: Claims 100%, actually ~30% complete
- **Stubs**: 40% of code is non-functional placeholders
- **False Claims**: AI, quantum, universal hardware, calculators
- **Foundation Issue**: Not a real bare-metal OS, just Linux abstraction

### The Opportunity
- Core architecture isn't terrible
- With focus, could be good educational OS
- Existing work provides foundation
- Honest assessment already in place

### The Fix
- Stop false claims (remove them from docs)
- Complete shell (16 lines -> functional CLI)
- Finish network stack (6-7 lines -> real TCP/IP)
- Implement scheduling (structure -> real algorithm)
- Add interrupts (missing -> functional IDT)
- Test everything (validate it works)
