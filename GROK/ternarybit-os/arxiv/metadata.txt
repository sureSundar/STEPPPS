Abstract:
We present TBOS (TernaryBit OS), a reliability-first substrate that operationalizes the STEPPPS model—Space, Time, Event, Psychology, Pixel, Prompt, Script—into a practical, on-device, low-footprint operating environment with graceful offload. TBOS unifies constrained generation (GBNF) for LLM outputs, content-addressed compute over a path-encoded filesystem (PXFS), radio/optical signal file systems (RF2S, PF2S), and an adaptive shell persona model to enable predictable, inspectable autonomy on devices ranging from calculators to servers. We demonstrate an optics pipeline (PF2S) and STEPPPS-aware transforms, job queuing with peer offload, and a Micro LLM that writes valid STEPPPS frames to RF2S/PXFS. Results show that (1) constrained decoding dramatically improves JSON validity and downstream composability; (2) compute-on-read with caching transforms CPU-bound tasks into I/O-limited retrieval; and (3) persona-controlled UX enforces graceful degradation while preserving observability.
